-   Added note on how to possibly charge multiple Tesla cars at the same time based on power allocation weighting.

v2.1c   16/12/2024

v2.1b   14/12/2024
-   Do not manually run this script if car is not at home, because it affects car charging anywhere.
-   Tidied syntax.

v2.1a    11/12/2024
-   Tidied code.
-   Fixed issue with occasional unexpected exit on start up due to charger status not up-to-date.

v2.1    9/12/2024

-   Get latest conditions from Tesla to update HA as last step before checking these conditions at beginning of repeat loop.

v1.1d   7/11/2024
-   Updated doc.

v1.1c   29/10/2024
-   Restoring charge limit to a higher value at script end will trigger Tesla to charge to the higher value. So don't save car_number_charge_limit in scene.
-   Cannot restore car_number_charging_amps reliably, so disabled scene save and restore.
-   Set minimal current before exit to avoid high current when starting next charging session.
-   Enforced valid charge limit range 50-100% for Tesla API.
-   Refactored setting car charge limit code.

-   Removed support for absolute stop time to facilitate off-peak night time charging.

v0.6    16/8/2023

-   Changed behaviour to always charge from excess solar when charger is connected, unless night time or toggled to charge from grid.
-   Updated doc.

v0.4    6/7/2023
-   Enhanced code to exit when reaching charge limit or if charger is turned off.
