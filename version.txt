-   Input number "Publish car charge limit" must be defined.
-   EV specific APIs are now optional, ie. charge limit, battery level, location, car wake up and force update HA.
-   Should support different EVs using EV specific HA integration.
-   Should support different EVs using OCPP and EV specific HA integration.
-   Should support different EVs using OCPP without EV specific HA integration (requires charge limit set in car).
-   Set initial charge current after turning on charger.
-   Set 0 current before turning off charger.

v3.0beta4   26/2/2025

v3.0beta2   18/2/2025
-   OCPP specific code to adjust car charging current.

v3.0beta1   5/2/2025
-   Modified from TeslaSolarCharger v2.1d https://github.com/flashg1/TeslaSolarCharger
-   Added support to control OCPP compatible charger.  Tested using OCPP simulator only.
-   Enforce charger minumum current if greater than 0, configurable using helper number.
-   Keep own charge limit if using OCPP.
-   Support skew to shift the power export/import curve left or right to achieve minimal power import.
-   Add user option to adjust current without stepping.
-   Tidied code and updated doc.

v2.1d   27/1/2025
-   Breaking change: Need to define helper number or template sensor for power offset to charge from grid.
-   Set current to 5A on exit because charger is turned off on reaching charge limit and had no chance to set current to 0.
-   Added note on how to possibly charge multiple Tesla cars at the same time based on power allocation weighting.

v2.1c   16/12/2024
-   Removed 30 seconds delay for overriding charge limit. To override charge limit, set charge limit from Tesla app and toggle off setting daily charge limit.

v2.1b   14/12/2024
-   Do not manually run this script if car is not at home, because it affects car charging anywhere.
-   Tidied syntax.

v2.1a    11/12/2024
-   Tidied code.
-   Fixed issue with occasional unexpected exit on start up due to charger status not up-to-date.

v2.1    9/12/2024
-   Breaking change: Need to create new input boolean to enable or disable use of daily car charge limit config. Sometimes it is easier to just use the Tesla app charge limit.

v2.0b   8/12/2024
-   Tidied up code syntax.
-   More diagnostic info during tracing by using "alias" command.

v2.0a   20/11/2024
-   Updated doc.
-   Took "turn charger on" out of choose condition to speed up current change on startup.
v2.0    14/11/2024
-   Use sun elevation triggers instead of sunrise/sunset time offsets to start and stop script.
-   Allow top up from grid if there is not enough solar electricity.
-   Removed feature to charge from grid with constant current.

v1.1e   13/11/2024
-   Get latest conditions from Tesla to update HA as last step before checking these conditions at beginning of repeat loop.

v1.1d   7/11/2024
-   Updated doc.
-   Setting the charge limit might cause car to turn on charger, so must get latest update before proceeding. Otherwise script can exit without turning off charger.

v1.1c   29/10/2024
-   Restoring charge limit to a higher value at script end will trigger Tesla to charge to the higher value. So don't save car_number_charge_limit in scene.
-   Cannot restore car_number_charging_amps reliably, so disabled scene save and restore.
-   Set minimal current before exit to avoid high current when starting next charging session.
-   Enforced valid charge limit range 50-100% for Tesla API.
-   Refactored setting car charge limit code.

v1.1b	8/10/2024
-   Wait 30 seconds after setting car charge limit to allow user override when not using Tesla app charge limit.
-   Finalised defaults.

v1.1    26/9/2024
-   Configurable daily car charge limit for 7 days.
-   Automatically adjust to the highest charge limit set within a rainy forecast period.

v1.0    2/10/2023
-   For exit loop criteria, need to test charger switched off condition before charge from grid condition.

v0.9    27/9/2023
-   Specify the minimum charging current to keep charging the car when there is no excess solar electricity.

v0.8    14/9/2023
-   Enforced integer input type, otherwise will get "TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'int' and 'str'".

v0.7    17/8/2023
-   Set default sunrise trigger to 30 minutes after sunrise.
-   Removed support for absolute stop time to facilitate off-peak night time charging.

v0.6    16/8/2023
-   Support multi-day charging using sunrise trigger.
-   Turning on charger will also trigger script action so that charging is always managed by script.

v0.5    30/7/2023
-   Changed behaviour to always charge from excess solar when charger is connected, unless night time or toggled to charge from grid.
-   Updated doc.

v0.4    6/7/2023
-   Enhanced code to exit when reaching charge limit or if charger is turned off.

v0.3    2/7/2023
-   Enforce max and min current limits.

v0.2    1/07/2023
-   Combined automation and script into one file.
-   Not using grid_power_net for trigger.

v0.1    20/6/2023
-   Creation.
